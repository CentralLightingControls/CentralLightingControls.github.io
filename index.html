        <p>Central Lighting Controls designs, and develops software components for the control of entertainment lighting equipment. We are the behind the scenes people for the people who make stuff for the people behind the scenes.</p>

<h2 id="generalphilosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="usestandardswhenavailable.">Use standards when available.</h3>

<p>If a standard is in place, we&#8217;ll use it. A ratified standard is always given preference to a defacto standard. The most glaring example is that we strongly prefer E1.31 &#8220;sACN&#8221; over Artnet. Not that Artnet isn&#8217;t great, but a standard is in place for transporting DMX style data over a network. </p>

<h3 id="componentsarelightweight.">Components are lightweight.</h3>

<p>The software components we create, run extremely efficiently. Communication with some components may at first seem limited, but these choices allow for minimal overhead and translation. For example the FadeEngine can operate over 10,000 concurrent fades on commodity hardware(1 GHz ARM Cortex-A8).</p>

<h3 id="mindfulofhistorynotafraidofthenew.">Mindful of history, not afraid of the new.</h3>

<p>Many paradigms in lighting control have roots in very old systems and methods. We embrace this and are respectful of it. However, especially with technological solutions, the new might just be well suited to the problem. We use a programming language that is &#8220;new&#8221; by conventional standards, but when viewed through the lens of lighting control (historically and modern networked systems), a functional style with strong concurrency patterns makes a whole lot of sense. It also helps that it was designed for building the backend of some of the largest web based systems. (<a href="http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">Go at Google</a>)</p>

<h2 id="workingwithcentrallightingcontrols">Working with Central Lighting Controls</h2>
<p>Central Lighting Controls is run by Miles Dudgeon. Miles has extensive experience in lighting for entertainment, product management, and software development. He has been a stagehand, programmer and lighting designer for live entertainment. Miles has worked for lighting companies such as; PRG, Rosco Laboratories, Wybron, and Prism Projection. He was a co-developer of the popular Wybron Swatch book app for iOS. His web and software work is extremely varied and award winning, selected clients include; American Express, The Tony Awards, The Image Bank, Monday Night Football, Golden Books, HBO, Timex, Sony Electronics, Dennis Publishing, and a major central Florida theme park.</p>

<p>We are open to several styles of licensing or consulting arrangements. Software that is generated from consulting and is unique to your application is normally treated as work for hire, source code and all rights are transfered to the customer upon completion. Components may be licensed as compiled applications for your target system, package files, or may include access to source files (normally through a private Github repository).</p>

<p>Discretion is important to us. We will never tell anyone who hires us, without your written approval (except the IRS and our accountant). Besides deer and woodchucks we don't get too many visitors either.

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>Our components are meant to be mixed and matched and integrated into other systems. We prefer to share data to and from our components using JSON or Go gob elements. A variety of other encoding types are easily implemented. The mechanics of the communication can also be easily configured to match your designs.</p>

<h3 id="shorthand"> ShortHand</h3>
<p><img src="img/sh-example.png" alt="ShortHand Screen Shot" align="right"/>ShortHand is an HTML and Javascript based component and command syntax that is designed to facilitate web based console command entry. Key combinations are minimized, drastic hand shifting is reserved for the least frequent commands. Optimized for number pad entry, it also works great for tablet and smart-phone entries. ShortHand parses much of the command line before leaving the client browser, and uses web sockets to send JSON back to the host application. It is very tolerant of typos and accidental entries, so the user can continue to move quickly.</p>

<h3 id="monitor">Monitor</h3>
<p>Simply watches sACN traffic. Property values can be presented graphically through a built in web server, or retrieved as JSON via a restful API. Web pages views receive data through real time web-socket connections, updating graphs or presenting specific values. URLs are human readable and remember-able, ie: <code>http://serveraddress/u1/bar</code> presents a constantly updating bar graph of all slots in universe #1, <code>http://serveraddress/u1/s1/line</code> presents a &#8220;rolling&#8221; line graph and actual values for universe 1, slot 1.</p>
<p>The API is similarly straight forward. <code>http://serveraddress/api/s1</code> will return a JSON array of all property values in universe 1 in the format <code>{s: 1, v: 255}</code>. While <code>http://serveraddress/api/s1/vnot/0</code> will return an array of all values that aren&#8217;t at 0.</p>

<h3 id="recorder">Recorder</h3>
<p>Saves raw DMX style data, recording multiple universes simultaneously. The quantity of universes is dependent on the hardware available. E1.31 is fully supported, we can also configure to capture rs485 (standard DMX) depending on the hardware. Frames are timestamped relative to each other. Data can be saved raw as an array of frames with all bytes in the packet represented, or non-destructively optimized only presenting values that change. The Recorder is configurable to accept 16-bit groups of slots, each 16-bit group can be configured as big or little endian, ensuring compatibility with that odd piece of gear. Individual slots (or slot groups) can easily be returned from a stream. Recorder can also be configured to return the property values in several formats; 8 or 16-bit integers, 8 or 16 bit hex values, percentage (0&#8211;100), percentage floats (0.0 - 100.0), or normalized floats (0.0 - 1.0). All float values are 32-bits, the precision of returned values is easily configurable. 64-bit values can be made available for very specialized applications. </p>

<h3 id="stmi">STMI</h3>
<p>STMI (Stream To Move Instruction), can analyze a saved data set from the Recorder component and return move instructions. Move instructions may be decoupled from specific slot assignments and applied to just about any other type of slot grouping. For example an instruction set captured with 8-bit data can be easily reassigned and used on a 16-bit slot group. The format is simple and straight forward <code>{v: 0.5, d: 10000}</code> where v is the target value and d the duration, shown here as v: float(0.0 - 1.0), d: in milliseconds. <code>fade to 50% over 10 seconds</code> With STMI it is feasible to record a stream of DMX style values and extrapolate individual tracking style cues.</p>

<h3 id="scue">sCue</h3>
<p>sCue or Simple Cue is a container for holding move fade tracking style cue data. Split fade times, linked cues, labeling, pause / resume execution, delay, and limited output are all available. The quantity of an sCue can easily be several thousands of instructions, depending on hardware. sCue is optimized for communication with our FadeEngine, but can be configured to deliver in many formats.</p>

<h3 id="gcue">gCue</h3>
<p>gCue or Group Cue, can queue many move instructions into one Cue. Many universes can be supported, with each individual property value changing on its own clock. Cue duration can be instant or spread out over days and weeks. gCues can be paused, resumed from any point relative to its start, faded in from current values, or enforce the gCue values at the beginning. </p>

<p>Both of our cue structures allow for filtering, reassignment of target device properties, and limiting. The can also be configured to allow &#8220;go to&#8221; commands, calculating all tracked values to that point.</p>

<h3 id="dmxcollector">DMXCollector</h3>
<p>The DMXCollector receives changing values from a FadeEngine, or other system. Limited values, parked slots, translation to or from 16-bit slot groups and if needed slot level filtering / reassignment. Multiple DMXCollectors can be initiated with manual or timed cross fades possible between them. Allowing playback of 2(or more) streams each containing multiple universes of fading values, cross fading into each other. Collectors output is sent out at regular intervals to DMX hardware or our E1.31 components.</p>
<p>Other collectors supporting ACN style data are planned for the near future, including ACN DMP.</p>
